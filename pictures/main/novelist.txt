"Der alte Schwung ist hin" (Werner Enke). A novelist who has stopped writing, an actress who has stopped acting, a director who has not yet stopped directing, though there's just not the same kind of energy to his films anymore. Call it newfound clarity and suddenly it is a plus. The big fights are a thing of the past, too, there's still a lingering resentment here and there, though. Alcohol is a thing of the past, too, the doctors finally have their ways, yet lets order some booze anyway. Sometimes it's good to drink. Sex is a thing of the past, too, and no, we really will not go there again, at least this time.

Given all this: how to create something new anyway. What is needed is a special place, a state of grace yet in a mundane way, like going through your day and meeting all those people you know, purely by chance.
